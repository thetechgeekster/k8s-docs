It is important to understand that HELM is NOT installed in the K8S server but
in client that has access to the server and does the deployment stuff...

You can install it in the server BUT IS NOT BEST PRACTICE!!!
Better on your machine!

$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod 700 get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
